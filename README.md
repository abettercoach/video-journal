This creative coding sketch is meant to convey what it feels like to journal. 
Inspired by the "Morning Pages" from the book "The Artist's Way," the user types
their free-form thoughts into a text input (or utilizes a speech-to-text tool like
Mac's built-in dictation tool). The text is displayed in the cavas, over time
turning into a clearer and clearer webcam video feed.
